## 🌿 **GIT WORKFLOW REMINDERS**

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Use Branches**
- **NEVER work directly on main branch** for new features
- **ALWAYS create a new branch** when starting work after a break
- **Use descriptive branch names** (feature/appointment-management)

### **Starting New Work Session**
```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# 4. Start working on the feature
```

### **Ending Work Session**
```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [description of changes]"

# 2. Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/[feature-name]

# 3. Create Pull Request (optional) or leave for review
```

### **Branch Naming Convention**
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/appointment-booking`)
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/otp-validation`)
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/auth-service`)
